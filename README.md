# Encrypted-Terminal-Messenger

Simple Messenger application Server-Client

Currently it's in early stage and it's terminal based only.

Communication between Server and Client is going on port 4242
Actually you just need server running and you can connect using NetCat.

Sample connection: nc localhost 4242

Even thought it's using encryption and hashing(with salt) I would **not recommend** to use it in real application.
